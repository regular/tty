#TTY

Imagine an old electric typewriter. It has a keyboard much like a modern laptop. The keyboard is connected via a cable with the print unit.

Now imagine you cut that cable in the middle and attach a very long extension cable that connects to your friend’s typewriter, in such a way, that your keyboard connects to your friend’s print unit and her keyboard connect to your print unit.

You just created a *teletype* system! The two end points are called *terminals*.(like, on an airport,  the endpoints of a plane flight are called terminal too) You sit in front of your teletype terminal and your friend sits in front of hers and you can now chat over a long distance. As usual in chat systems, you soon start to use a lot of abbreviations to save time and paper. Actually, you quickly become obsessed with abbreviations. One of those abbreviations is *tty* for teletype and *term* for terminal.

We’ll talk about how the characters are actually transmitted in the Science and History thread.
